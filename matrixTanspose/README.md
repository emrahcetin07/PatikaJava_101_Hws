Write a program in Java that finds the transpose of a matrix created with multidimensional arrays.

Taking the transpose of the matrix means that the rows and columns of the matrix with the same number are replaced. 
The matrix obtained as a result of this process is the transpose of the initial matrix. At this stage, the transpose of a matrix of kxn becomes a matrix of nxk. 
For example, let's have an A matrix. The transpose of this matrix A is denoted by A^T (T over A).

For example, the transpose of the following 2x3 matrix A is a 2x3 matrix A^T.
