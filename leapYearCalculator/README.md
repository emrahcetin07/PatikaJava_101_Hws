What is a Leap Year?

A leap year is a year with 366 days instead of 365 in the Gregorian calendar. This extra day (leap day)
is obtained by adding February 29 to February, which is normally 28 days.

How to Calculate a Leap Year?

As a general rule, leap years are years that are a multiple of the digit 4:

1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024 like.
of the years that are a multiple of 100, only those that can be divided into 400 without remainder are leap years:

For example, the years 1200, 1600, 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years.
The reason why only those that are exactly divisible by 400 are considered leap years is to eliminate the error caused 
by the fact that an astronomical year is approximately 365,242 days, not 365,25 days.
