Write a program that finds out if the year entered by the user is no longer in Java.

As a general rule, leap years are years that are a multiple of the digit 4:

1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024 like.
of the years that are a multiple of 100, only those that can be divided into 400 without remainder are leap years:

For example, the years 1200, 1600, 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years.
The reason why only those that are exactly divisible by 400 are considered leap years is to eliminate the error 
caused by the fact that an astronomical year is approximately 365,242 days, not 365,25 days.
