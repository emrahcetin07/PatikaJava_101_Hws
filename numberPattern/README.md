In Java, write a "Recursive" method without using a loop that follows the following rule based on the value of n received from the user.

Rule : Subtract the digit 5 from the entered number until the entered number is 0 or negative. Print the final value on the screen during each subtraction operation. 
After the number is negative or 0, add 5 again. Again, print the last value of the number on the screen at each addition operation.
